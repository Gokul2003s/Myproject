Create a Chatbot Using Python


Introduction:

This repository contains Python code for a customer service chatbot implemented using Flask, SpaCy, and the GPT-2 language model. The chatbot is designed to provide high-quality support to users, answering their queries on a website or application.

Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

Python 3.x
Flask
SpaCy
Pandas
Transformers (from Hugging Face)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

bash:
pip install flask spacy pandas transformers

Additionally, download the SpaCy model using:

bash:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Download the GPT-2 model using the following Python code:

python:

from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

Setting Up the Environment

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. To create a virtual environment, run the following commands in your project directory:

bash:

python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
bash:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:
bash:

source venv/bin/activate


How to Run:

Place your dataset file dialogs.txt in the root directory. The dataset should be in tab-separated format with columns "question" and "answer".

Run the Flask application:

bash:
python app.py
Access the chatbot interface in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

Dataset
The dataset (dialogs.txt) used for this chatbot contains pairs of questions and corresponding answers. It's utilized to train the chatbot and provide predefined responses. Please replace provide_source_link_here with the actual source link of your dataset.

Usage
Users can input their queries through the chat interface. If the query matches a question in the dataset, the corresponding answer is provided. If there is no match in the dataset, the chatbot uses the GPT-2 model to generate a response.

Additional Notes
The chatbot's responses can be further enhanced by integrating advanced models like GPT-3.
Implement feedback mechanisms to continuously improve response quality.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary API keys and permissions if you plan to use advanced language models like GPT-3.
